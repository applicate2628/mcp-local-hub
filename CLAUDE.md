# mcp-local-hub — Claude Code notes

This file documents developer workflows and conventions for this repo that
are load-bearing enough to be worth surfacing to the agent by default. Add
new sections as they become necessary.

## GUI frontend (Phase 3B-II onward)

The web UI lives under `internal/gui/frontend/` (Vite + TypeScript +
Preact). Built artifacts land in `internal/gui/assets/` and are
committed — `go build` does not require Node.

### Day-to-day frontend dev (hot reload)

```bash
# Terminal 1: Go backend with a fixed port so Vite proxy can target it.
go run ./cmd/mcphub gui --no-browser --no-tray --port 9125

# Terminal 2: Vite dev server on 5173 with /api → 9125 proxy.
cd internal/gui/frontend
npm install  # once
npm run dev
# Browse http://localhost:5173
```

### Build + smoke against embedded assets (what ships)

```bash
cd internal/gui/frontend
npm run build
cd ../../..
go run ./cmd/mcphub gui --no-browser --no-tray --port 9125
# Browse http://127.0.0.1:9125
```

### Regenerate the embedded bundle (CI + commits)

```bash
go generate ./internal/gui/...
```

This calls `npm run build` under `internal/gui/frontend/` and
overwrites `internal/gui/assets/{index.html,app.js,style.css}`. Always
rebuild before committing frontend changes so the embedded bundle
matches the source.

### Tests

- Frontend unit tests (pure helpers): `cd internal/gui/frontend && npm run test`
- Type-check: `cd internal/gui/frontend && npm run typecheck`
- Go-side embed smoke: `go test ./internal/gui/`

## GUI E2E tests (Phase 3B-II onward)

End-to-end browser tests live under `internal/gui/e2e/` (Playwright +
TypeScript, headless Chromium). They spawn a real `mcphub gui`
binary per-test with `HOME`/`USERPROFILE` redirected to a temp dir
so tests never touch the developer's real config, and drive the
Preact UI against the live Go backend. The backend scheduler is
redirected to an empty-noop via `MCPHUB_E2E_SCHEDULER=none` so
/api/status returns [] regardless of the host's installed
mcp-local-hub-* tasks.

### One-time setup

```bash
# Frontend deps are required because global-setup.ts runs `npm run build`
# on the frontend before building the Go binary. Fresh clones need this
# step first.
cd internal/gui/frontend
npm ci

cd ../e2e
npm ci
npx playwright install chromium --with-deps
```

### Running

```bash
cd internal/gui/e2e
npm test                # headless
npm run test:headed     # see the browser
npm run test:debug      # Playwright Inspector step-through
```

The `global-setup.ts` rebuilds `internal/gui/assets/` then compiles
`cmd/mcphub` into `internal/gui/e2e/bin/` once per run. Each test
spawns that binary with `--port 0` so the OS picks a free port —
tests are parallel-safe.

### CI (Windows-only)

Run E2E as a separate job from `go test` on a Windows runner. The GUI's
`/api/status` route goes through the real scheduler; `scheduler.New()`
on Linux/macOS returns "not implemented" and the status route 500s, so
Dashboard/Logs tests would fail on non-Windows runners. Pin this job
to `windows-latest` until a scheduler-less test seam exists.

```yaml
jobs:
  e2e:
    runs-on: windows-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-go@v5
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with: { node-version: 20 }
      - run: cd internal/gui/frontend && npm ci
      - run: cd internal/gui/e2e && npm ci
      - run: cd internal/gui/e2e && npx playwright install chromium
      - run: cd internal/gui/e2e && npm test
```

### What's covered

- Shell: sidebar, five nav links, hash routing, active-link highlight.
- Servers: matrix columns (Server + 4 clients + Port + State), empty-body state on clean tmpHome, Apply disabled with no dirty cells, uncheck-via-hub + Apply posts /api/demigrate narrowed to cell, mixed Apply dispatches demigrate-before-migrate ordering, demigrate failure always-reloads and retains failed entry for retry, via-hub tooltip describes Uncheck-and-Apply semantic (no more 'mcphub rollback --client' stale text), per-client gate + 3-outcome pruning (failed + gated retained, succeeded pruned) with second-Apply retry firing exactly the previously-gated migrate.
- Migration: h1, empty-state copy, group sections hidden on empty home, hashchange swap from Servers, full POST /api/dismiss → on-disk JSON → GET /api/dismissed round-trip, /api/scan-unfiltered regression guard (seed + dismiss + re-scan).
- Add server: empty-state + debounced YAML preview, live name-regex inline error, single-daemon flat bindings, cascade rename/delete with confirm, Save writes manifest, Save&Install port-conflict failure path with Retry Install banner, Paste YAML import, sidebar-intercept unsaved-changes guard, Advanced kind-toggle (workspace/global reveals/hides languages+port_pool), Advanced always-visible fields survive kind toggles.
- Edit server: #/edit-server?name= load from disk, name+kind locked, Save → Reinstall banner, Force Save with external-edit hash-mismatch preserving `_preservedRaw` top-level fields, nested-unknown read-only mode, load failure banner, sidebar-intercept when dirty, 4+-daemon matrix view, workspace-scoped Advanced (languages + port_pool), internal-ID cascade daemon rename, hashchange cancel/accept dirty-guard, Paste YAML → Save race (version-counter invariant).
- Dashboard: empty-cards state on fresh home, `/api/events` SSE connection opens on mount.
- Logs: picker + controls render, notice text on no-daemons state, controls disabled when no eligible entries.

52 smoke tests total (3 shell + 8 servers + 6 migration + 13 add-server + 17 edit-server + 2 dashboard + 3 logs), ~30s wall-time on a warm machine.

### What's NOT covered (future)

- Populated-row matrix tests (needs a client-config seed fixture — deferred to a follow-up plan item).
- Real migrate/restart flows (needs populated client configs).
- Dashboard SSE cleanup on screen swap — the `useEffect` return is the implementation, but Playwright's request API cannot observe connection close. A future CDP-based test could.
- Workspace-scoped daemons (Phase 3B-II D3).
- Tray icon (Windows-only, native surface Playwright can't reach — manual smoke per D2).
- Linux/macOS (blocked on scheduler test seam).
