// Demigrate rolls (server, client) pairs back from hub-HTTP to their
// pre-migrate shape by reading each client's most recent backup and
// writing the named entry (or removing it, if the backup predates
// migrate adding it). The set of (server, client) pairs is derived
// from each server's manifest.client_bindings intersected with
// ClientsInclude — mirroring MigrateFrom's shape so Demigrate reverses
// exactly the rows Migrate would produce. Entries in other clients with
// the same server name are NOT touched.
//
// Multi-server / repeat-migrate behavior: when multiple servers are
// migrated from the same client — or the same server is migrated more
// than once — the latest timestamped backup may already hold earlier
// entries in hub-managed form. For those, Demigrate falls back
// automatically to the pristine `-original` sentinel (the one-shot
// pre-hub snapshot Client.Backup() writes on first call; never
// overwritten). If both the latest backup AND the sentinel refuse
// (e.g. the sentinel was tampered with, or never written), Demigrate
// surfaces a Failed row naming both paths so the operator can restore
// manually. Silent rewriting of hub-managed data is strictly worse
// than a clear failure, so the defensive check in each adapter's
// RestoreEntryFromBackup does not compromise.
//
// Errors per-(server, client) are captured in the report; the function
// returns nil unless a setup-level problem applies to every row.
